## NFO:
> WebRTC is often talked about on VPN Websites. <br />
WebRTC is a Technology that allows your Browser to have Video and Voice Communication Abilities. <br />
When you use Google Meet to hold a Video Conference, you’re using WebRTC. <br />
The same is with the Facebook Messenger Video Call. <br />
There are other Applications that make use of WebRTC. For Example, if you’re on Discord. <br />
It enables live Communications in real Time.
<br />

## What is WebRTC Leak?
> WebRTC works by sending Audio/Video Feeds between two Entities. <br />
This means your Browser will share some of your Information with the Website, which will include your IP Address. <br />
And these Channels can bypass the encrypted Tunnel you have Setup. <br />
So basically, a WebRTC Leak can reveal your real IP Address even if you are using a VPN.
<br />

## How to know about a WebRTC Leak?
> To see if your IP is leaked go to [IPLEAK.NET](https://ipleak.net/). <br />
If you see your real IP on the Website, your IP is being leaked. <br />
If you can see the IP Address of the VPN Server, you’re safe and your browsing is secure.
<br />

## WebRTC Leaks can be blocked
> One Way is by getting a VPN that doesn’t allow these Leaks. <br />
Another Option is to block the WebRTC Requests directly from the Browser. <br />
You can also use browser Extensions if you cannot disable WebRTC.
<br />

## Note:
> Keep in Mind that if you disable WebRTC, you won’t be able to enjoy the Functionalities that come with it.
<br />
<br />

## Disabling WebRTC in Chrome:
> You cannot disable WebRTC in Chrome. The only thing you can do is use Add-ons. A good Chrome Add-on is [WebRTC Leak Prevent](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-leak-prevent/eiadekoaikejlgdbkbdfeijglgfdalml?hl=en). <br />
It controls the hidden WebRTC Settings and protects you against the Leaks.

## Disabling WebRTC in Chrome Mobile
1. Type this URL: ```chrome://flags/#disable-webrtc``` in your Android Chrome Address Bar. It will open a Settings Page
2. Scroll down and you’ll find WebRTC STUN Origin Header. You can disable it here
3. You can even disable WebRTC Hardware Video Encoding and decoding Options if you want
<br />

## Disabling WebRTC in Mozilla Firefox:
1. Go to the URL Bar, type ```about:config``` and press Enter
2. Firefox will display a Warning Message. Click on ```Accept the Risk and Continue```
3. It will take you to another Page. In the Search Bar, type: ```media.peerconnection.enabled```
4. Double click on the Row and change its Value to "false". Now WebRTC will be disabled.
<br />

## Disabling WebRTC on Safari Browser:
1. On Safari, visit ```Preferences```
2. Check ```Show Develop menu in menu bar```
3. In the Develop Section, go to ```Experimental Features```
4. Click on ```Remove Legacy WebRTC API```
<br />

## Disabling WebRTC in Opera:
> Opera doesn’t have a Way to disable WebRTC. You can use third-party Addons like ```WebRTC Leak Prevent``` just like you did with Chrome. <br />
Keep in mind that these Extensions do not fix the Leak. Instead, they block the Attempts the Websites make to collect IP Addresses.
<br />

## Disabling WebRTC on Microsoft Edge:
1. Open Edge and type: ```about:flags``` in the Address Bar & press Enter
2. You’ll see WebRTC here. Under that, there’s an Option to hide your real IP Address. Check the Box: ```Hide my local IP address over WebRTC connections``` to activate.
<br />

## How to stay secure:
> Make sure you use a VPN. The VPN should be able to bypass the WebRTC Leak. <br />
With a VPN, you can use a Secure Browsers like LibreWolf that does not keep any of your Details.
